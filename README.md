# Practice: Use the basic HTML elements

Use this space to practice writing the basic elements. Don't worry about the content of the page, it can just say "This is a heading" for the headings, and "this is a link" for the links.

Try to include:
- a paragraph
- a link 
- an image (there's an example image called `example.jpeg` in the sidebar)
- two headings, of different levels
- an unordered list
- an ordered list
- some emphasized and strongly emphasized text

Re-read the lesson or look up the elements using Google if you get stuck.
